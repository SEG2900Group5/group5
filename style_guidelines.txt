Concept for Electra 
===============================
This pastel minimalist environment is to be user-friendly and convey the warmth of a home.
The site must be easy to navigate to accommodate a less mobile demographic. 
Notably, the colour should be easy on the eyes, and this is why we used a pastel colour set. 

Colours
========
Colours are essential for a website, and this is why we want to invite the user in with warmth.
